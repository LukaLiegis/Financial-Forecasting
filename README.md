The idea is the same as ... 

While it does predict the future price of the asset, the point of it is to look at it as a 

Fitting the linear model to train data.
```python
linear = LinearRegression()
linear = linear.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## To do:
- Add wavelets and see if they actually help.
- Create an RL environment that trades using predicted values.
